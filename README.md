# octoland

Octo Land is an advanced Grasshopper plugin for landscape design and analysis. It provides tools for extracting and analyzing morphological characteristics of terrain surfaces, such as elevation, surface normals, and more. Designed with performance and usability in mind, Octo Land simplifies workflows for architects, landscape designers, and engineers working on complex surface-based terrain designs.

Features
Morphological Analysis:

Extract various morphological properties of terrain surfaces, such as:

Elevation: Relative and absolute measurements based on a reference plane.
Normals: Analyze surface orientation and slope direction.
More features to come!
Mesh Processing:

Generate high-quality meshes from surfaces for visualization and further computation.
Highly customizable resolutions for accurate analysis.
Data Sampling:

Dense sampling methods for large surfaces.
Export sampled points and their corresponding properties (e.g., elevation, normals).
Statistical Insights:

Calculate key metrics like average elevation, standard deviation, and more.
High-Performance Parallelization:

Built-in parallel processing ensures fast computation, even for large-scale terrains.
